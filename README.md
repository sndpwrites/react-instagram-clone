## React Instagram Copy

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/).
Icons are used from [Styled-icons](https://styled-icons.js.org/)
My feeble attempt at redesigning the instagram web writing my own CSS and React components. The plan is to eventually rewrite the whole webpage of https://instagram.com using my own ideas. The goal of this project is to learn best approaches in design and development of UI/UX in a popular social media site.

TO-DO

1. API Endpoints to handle data(everything is hardcoded right now)
2. Event handlers
3. Writer better CSS?
4. Learn CSS animation
